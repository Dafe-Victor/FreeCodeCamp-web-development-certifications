          Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 â€“ December 8, 2019),
          known professionally as Juice Wrld (pronounced "juice world"; 
          stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. 
          He was a leading figure in the emo rap and SoundCloud rap genres which 
          garnered mainstream attention during the mid-late 2010s. 
          His stage name, which he stated represents "taking over the world", 
          was derived from the crime thriller film Juice (1992).

         Higgins began his career as an independent artist in 2015 and
         signed a recording contract with Grade A Productions and Interscope
         Records in 2017. He gained recognition with the diamond-certified single
         "Lucid Dreams", which peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. 
         It was included on his triple platinum debut album Goodbye & Good Riddance 
         (2018), alongside the singles "All Girls Are the Same", "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", 
         and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted on the Hot 100. 
         He then collaborated with Future on the mixtape Wrld on Drugs (2018), and 
         released his second album, Death Race for Love, in 2019; it contained the hit single
         "Robbery" and became Higgins' first number one debut on the US Billboard 200.

      <p>
         Higgins died following a drug overdose on December 8, 2019.
         His first posthumous album, Legends Never Die (2020), matched
         chart records for most successful posthumous debut and for most 
         U.S. top-ten entries from one album, while the single "Come & Go"
         (with Marshmello) became Higgins' second song to reach number two 
         on the Hot 100. His second posthumous album, Fighting Demons, was 
         released in 2021 alongside the documentary film Juice Wrld: Into the
         Abyss, and contained the US top 20 single "Already Dead".

          <h2> <i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i>  Early Life</h2>

          <p>
             Jarad Anthony Higgins was born on December 2, 1998, in Chicago, Illinois.
             He grew up in the South Suburbs spending his childhood in Calumet Park. 
             He then later moved to Homewood, where he attended Homewood-Flossmoor High 
             School and graduated in 2017. His parents divorced when he was three years old, 
             and his father left, leaving his mother to raise him and an older brother as a 
             single parent. Higgins' father died in June 2019. Higgins' mother was very religious 
             and conservative, and did not let him listen to hip hop. He was allowed to listen
             to rock and pop music, however, being introduced to artists including Billy Idol, 
             Blink-182, Black Sabbath, Fall Out Boy, Megadeth and Panic! at the Disco through 
             video games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Guitar Hero. Higgins was a heavy
             drug user during his childhood and teens. He began drinking lean in sixth grade
             and using Percocet and Xanax in 2013. Higgins additionally smoked cigarettes before
             quitting in his last year of high school because of health issues. He learned to play 
             the piano at four years old, having been inspired by his mother, Carmella Wallace, 
             who later began paying for lessons. He then took up the guitar and drums while also
             playing the trumpet for band class. In his sophomore year of high school, he began 
             posting songs to SoundCloud which he recorded on his smartphone. Around this time, 
             Higgins began to take rapping more seriously.

            <h2> <i class="fa-solid fa-suitcase"></i> Career</h2>

            <p>
               Higgins developed as an artist in his first year of high school. 
               His first track, "Forever", was released on SoundCloud in 2015 
               under the name JuicetheKidd. Higgins recorded most of his first tracks 
               on a cellphone, uploading them to SoundCloud in his sophomore year. 
               He changed his name from JuicetheKidd, a name inspired by his affection
               for rapper Tupac Shakur's role in the film Juice, to Juice Wrld because 
               he and his associates believed the change would benefit his career. 
               In an interview with the Atlanta radio station WHTA, Higgins revealed that
               the latter part of his stage name initially had no meaning but that he came
               to think it "represents taking over the world". "Too Much Cash", Higgins' 
               first track to be produced by frequent collaborator Nick Mira, was released 
               in 2017. While releasing projects and songs on SoundCloud, Higgins worked 
               in a factory but was dissatisfied with the job; he was fired within two weeks.
               After joining the internet collective Internet Money, Higgins released his debut
               full-length EP, 9 9 9, on June 15, 2017, with the song "Lucid Dreams" breaking out
               and growing his following. Higgins also briefly performed under the name Juice in early 2017. 
               In mid-2017, he received attention from artists such as Waka Flocka Flame and Southside, as well
               as fellow Chicago artists G Herbo and Lil Bibby. He subsequently signed with Lil Bibby's co-owned
              record label, Grade A Productions.
